# Composer extension for Chassis
The Composer extension automatically sets up your Chassis instance to be able to use composer on your Chassis box.

## Activation
Ensure you have a Chassis instance set up locally already.

```
# In your Chassis dir:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Chassis/Composer.git extensions/composer

# Reprovision
cd ..
vagrant provision
```

Composer has now been installed inside your Chassis box.
